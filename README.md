# Bellybutton Biodiversity
## The included analysis allows study volunteers to view their individual dashboard for biodiversity of their sample. 
Each volunteer has been assigned an ID number. Using the drop-down menu, volunteers can select their individual ID number and the dashboard will filter their individual results. When selected, the panel will dispaly factors assigned to their ID number (gender, age, location, etc.).
- The first visual is a guage indicating the washing frequency reported for this participant on a scale of 1-10.
- The second visual is a bar chart that graphs the most 10 abundant bacteria identified in their sample. My hovering over each bar, 
the volunteer can view the bacteria identification while the bar itself displays the sample value.
- The third visual is a bubble chart that displays all bacteria identified in their individual sample, with bubble size representing the amount 
each bacteria type. By hovering over each bubble, volunteers can view the bacteria identification and sample value.

### By providing this dashboard for volunteers, volunteers will be made aware of their sample analysis in the event that they are a match for a particularly desirable bacteria strain (in this case, for Improbable Beef's endeavors to develop synthetic beef).
